GreenScript aims to provide a tool for web developer to manage javascript and css dependencies and simplify the rendering of javascript/css file references in HTML file. The tool also provides facility to help javascript and css file minimizing.

At the moment GreenScript provides <a href="http://www.playframework.org">PlayFramework!</a> plugin only. Moving forward, I will try to get it support to other Java or even other language web frameworks.
